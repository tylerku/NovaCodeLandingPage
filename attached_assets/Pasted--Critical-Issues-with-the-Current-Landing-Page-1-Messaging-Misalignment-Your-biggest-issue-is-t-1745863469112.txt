🔥 Critical Issues with the Current Landing Page
1. Messaging Misalignment
✅ Your biggest issue is the misleading “Reality Without Code” message.

Problem: It suggests a no-code platform — but NovaCode is real custom-built software, powered by expert engineers and AI.

Fix: Clarify that NovaCode uses elite engineering + AI to build real code faster, better, and more affordably.

2. AI Advantage Not Highlighted
✅ Right now, visitors have no idea AI is your competitive superpower.

Problem: Your most important selling point (AI-powered speed, quality, and savings) is invisible.

Fix: Add a clear “Why NovaCode?” section explaining:

Real engineers. Supercharged by AI. Delivered at a fraction of traditional cost and time.

3. Trust & Process Explanation Missing
✅ You promise a "Launch Hour," but the landing page doesn't explain it.

Problem: There's no clear customer journey or reassurance that there's a real, fast, simple process.

Fix: Add a visual 3-step or 4-step “How It Works” section immediately after the hero.

4. Big Stats Feel Hollow
✅ Stats like 100%+, 90%+, 5x are impressive but lack context.

Problem: They look like marketing fluff without backup.

Fix: Add a small line of credibility under each one (e.g., “Based on 10+ projects delivered under budget”).

5. Tone and Energy Need Refinement
✅ The page feels slightly generic, not transformational.

Problem: NovaCode is about awakening possibility, not just cheap software.

Fix: Rewrite the Hero section to project vision, empowerment, and trustworthiness.
